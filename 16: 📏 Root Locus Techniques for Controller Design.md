## **üß© Ice-Breaker**

Imagine balancing a stick vertically on your hand. If you slowly move your hand, the stick tilts but you can bring it back. Root locus is like plotting all the possible positions of the stick over time as you change system parameters.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Root Locus**

**Definition:** Root locus is a graphical method to study how the **poles of a closed-loop system** move in the **s-plane** as a system parameter (usually gain) varies.

**Purpose:**

* Analyze **stability changes** with gain
* Design controllers by selecting appropriate gain values
* Visualize system transient behavior

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts**

* **Open-loop poles and zeros**: Start and end points of root locus branches
* **Branches**: Paths traced by poles as gain changes
* **Breakaway and break-in points**: Points where poles split or converge
* **Asymptotes**: Directions of branches as gain ‚Üí ‚àû

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Steps to Construct Root Locus**

1. Plot open-loop poles (x) and zeros (o) on s-plane
2. Determine number of branches (equal to number of poles)
3. Find real-axis segments where root locus exists
4. Calculate asymptotes and intersection points
5. Locate breakaway/break-in points
6. Sketch the path as gain varies

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Life Examples**

* **Servo Motor Position Control** ‚öôÔ∏è: Adjusting gain to minimize overshoot and settling time
* **Inverted Pendulum Stabilization** ü§π: Choosing gain to stabilize the pendulum
* **DC Motor Speed Control** üöó: Ensuring smooth acceleration without oscillation
* **Flight Control System** ‚úàÔ∏è: Maintaining aircraft stability under varying gains

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages of Root Locus** ‚úÖ

* Provides **visual insight** into system stability and transient behavior
* Useful for **controller gain selection**
* Can design compensators to improve performance
* Works for **SISO systems** effectively

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations / Cons** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Primarily for **SISO systems**; MIMO is more complex
* Only shows **pole movement**; doesn‚Äôt directly show time-domain response
* High-order systems can be challenging to plot by hand
* Requires knowledge of system poles and zeros

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Controller Design Using Root Locus**

* **Proportional (P) Controller:** Move poles for desired damping and speed
* **PD Controller:** Adds derivative action to shift root locus left and increase damping
* **PI Controller:** Adds integral action to reduce steady-state error
* **Lead/Lag Compensators:** Adjust pole-zero locations to shape root locus for stability and performance
