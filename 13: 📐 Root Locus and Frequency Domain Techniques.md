## **üß© Ice-Breaker**

Imagine adjusting the tension on a guitar string to achieve the perfect note. The way the string vibrates changes as you tune it. Similarly, **root locus and frequency domain methods** show how system behavior changes when parameters vary.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Root Locus**

**Definition:** Root locus is a graphical method to study how the **poles of a closed-loop system** move in the s-plane as a system parameter (usually gain K) changes.

**Purpose:**

* Analyze **stability** as gain varies
* Design controllers for desired **transient response**
* Predict system behavior before implementation

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Rules for Drawing Root Locus**

1. Root locus starts at **open-loop poles** and ends at **open-loop zeros**
2. Symmetrical about the **real axis**
3. Number of branches = number of poles
4. Real axis segments belong to the root locus if an **odd number of poles and zeros** lie to the right
5. Asymptotes show direction for branches going to infinity

**Example:** Second-order system with transfer function $G(s) = \frac{K}{s(s+2)}$

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Frequency Domain Techniques**

**a) Bode Plot** üìà

* Shows **magnitude** and **phase** vs frequency
* Determines **gain margin** and **phase margin**
* Useful for **stability and performance assessment**

**b) Nyquist Plot** üîÑ

* Encodes frequency response in a polar plot
* **Nyquist criterion** predicts closed-loop stability
* Handles **open-loop unstable systems**

**c) Nichols Chart**

* Combines gain and phase information in a single plot
* Useful for **gain and phase margin analysis**

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages**

* Visualizes how pole locations affect system stability
* Guides **controller design** (PID tuning, compensators)
* Helps predict **transient and steady-state behavior**
* Applicable to **both SISO and MIMO systems**

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations / Cons**

* Requires **linear models**
* Complex for high-order systems
* Interpretation may be difficult for beginners
* Frequency domain methods need **accurate system data**

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Life Examples**

* **Cruise Control Design** üöó: Adjusting gain to ensure smooth acceleration without overshoot
* **Servo Motor Control** ‚öôÔ∏è: Root locus shows effect of controller gain on speed and stability
* **Power System Stabilizer** ‚ö°: Nyquist plot ensures voltage stability under load changes
* **Aircraft Pitch Control** ‚úàÔ∏è: Bode plot helps design compensators for safe maneuvering
