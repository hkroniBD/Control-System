### 🌟 1. Introduction

Control systems can be classified in several ways: **feedback usage**, **control action**, **nature of the system**, **signal type**, and **control strategy**. This lecture covers the major types with practical examples.

### 🔄 2. Classification Based on Feedback

#### **1. Open-Loop Systems**

* **Definition:** No feedback; output is not compared with desired value.
* **Examples:** Microwave oven (time-based heating), Washing machine with fixed cycle.

#### **2. Closed-Loop Systems**

* **Definition:** Uses feedback to adjust the system.
* **Examples:** Air conditioner with thermostat, Cruise control in cars.

### ⚙️ 3. Classification Based on Control Action

#### **1. Manual Control**

* Example: Adjusting water flow in a faucet by hand.

#### **2. Automatic Control**

* Example: Automatic voltage regulator in a generator.

---

### 🌍 4. Classification Based on System Nature

#### **1. Linear Systems** – Example: RC circuit.

#### **2. Nonlinear Systems** – Example: Car suspension system.

#### **3. Time-Invariant Systems** – Example: Resistor network.

#### **4. Time-Variant Systems** – Example: Satellite orbit control.

### 📡 5. Classification Based on Signal Type

#### **1. Continuous-Time Systems**

* Signals vary continuously with time.
* Example: Temperature control in a furnace.

#### **2. Discrete-Time Systems**

* Signals exist at discrete time intervals.
* Example: Digital control of a stepper motor.

#### **3. Hybrid Systems**

* Combination of continuous and discrete.
* Example: Modern industrial process control using PLCs.

---

### 🧠 6. Classification Based on Control Strategy

#### **1. Adaptive Control**

* Adjusts parameters in real-time.
* Example: Adaptive flight control in aircraft.

#### **2. Optimal Control**

* Seeks best performance according to a defined criterion.
* Example: Energy-optimal trajectory planning for robots.

#### **3. Robust Control**

* Maintains performance despite uncertainties.
* Example: Wind turbine pitch control under varying wind speeds.

### 📊 7. Comparative Table: Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop

| Feature    | Open-Loop       | Closed-Loop    |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Feedback   | Not used        | Used           |
| Accuracy   | Lower           | Higher         |
| Complexity | Simple          | Complex        |
| Cost       | Low             | High           |
| Example    | Washing machine | Cruise control |

### 💡 8. Key Takeaways

* Classification can be based on feedback, action type, nature, signal type, or strategy.
* Knowing the classification helps in selecting the right control method for an application.

### 🔍 9. Sample Viva Questions

1. Give two differences between continuous-time and discrete-time systems.
2. Define adaptive control with an example.
3. Is a PLC-based system continuous, discrete, or hybrid?

---

### ✅ 10. Solutions to Viva Questions

1. Continuous: Signals change continuously; Discrete: Signals exist at discrete instants.
2. Control that changes its parameters in real-time; Example: Adaptive flight control.
3. Hybrid, as it combines continuous process control with discrete logic.
