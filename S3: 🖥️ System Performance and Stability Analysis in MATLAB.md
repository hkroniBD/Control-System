**Lecture 3: üñ•Ô∏è System Performance and Stability Analysis in MATLAB**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Performance and Stability Analysis**

* System performance involves evaluating how fast, accurate, and stable a system responds to inputs.
* Stability ensures the system output remains bounded and predictable under disturbances.
* MATLAB provides tools for time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Domain Performance Metrics**

* **Rise Time (Tr):** Time to reach 90% of final value.
* **Settling Time (Ts):** Time to remain within a certain error band.
* **Peak Overshoot (Mp):** Maximum deviation from final value.
* **Steady-State Error (Ess):** Difference between desired and actual final value.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ MATLAB Example: Step Response Analysis**

```matlab
s = tf('s');
G = 5/(s^2 + 2*s + 5);
step(G);
y = stepinfo(G);
disp(y); % Displays rise time, settling time, overshoot, etc.
```

* `stepinfo()` provides a quick overview of time-domain performance.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Root Locus Analysis**

* Shows how system poles move with varying gain.
* Helps design for desired stability and transient response.

```matlab
rlocus(G);
title('Root Locus of the System');
```

* Adjust system gain and observe pole locations to ensure stability.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Bode Plot Analysis**

* Evaluates frequency response: gain margin, phase margin, bandwidth.

```matlab
bode(G);
grid on;
[GM, PM, Wcg, Wcp] = margin(G);
disp(['Gain Margin: ', num2str(GM), ', Phase Margin: ', num2str(PM)]);
```

* Gain Margin (GM) and Phase Margin (PM) indicate how close the system is to instability.

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Nyquist Plot Analysis**

* Determines stability by evaluating encirclements of the critical point (-1,0) in the complex plane.

```matlab
nyquist(G);
title('Nyquist Plot of the System');
```

* Useful for MIMO systems and systems with delays.

**7Ô∏è‚É£ Pole-Zero Map Analysis**

* Visualizes pole and zero locations to infer stability and transient behavior.

```matlab
pzmap(G);
title('Pole-Zero Map');
```

* Poles in the left-half plane indicate stable system.
