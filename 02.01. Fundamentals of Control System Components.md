### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Key Components of a Control System

#### **1. Plant / Process**

* **Definition:** The part of the system to be controlled.
* **Examples:**

  * A motor in a robotic arm.
  * A boiler in a power plant.
  * An air conditioning unit.

#### **2. Sensors**

* **Function:** Measure output variables (temperature, speed, pressure).
* **Examples:**

  * Thermocouples for temperature.
  * Tachometers for speed.
  * Pressure transducers for fluid systems.

#### **3. Controller**

* **Function:** Compares measured output with desired setpoint and calculates corrective action.
* **Examples:**

  * PID controller in industrial automation.
  * ECU (Electronic Control Unit) in vehicles.

#### **4. Actuators**

* **Function:** Convert control signals into physical action.
* **Examples:**

  * Electric motors.
  * Hydraulic pistons.
  * Servo motors.

#### **5. Feedback Path**

* **Function:** Returns output measurement to the controller for adjustment.
* **Importance:** Enables closed-loop operation.

### üìä 3. Example: Automatic Room Temperature Control

* **Plant:** Air conditioning system.
* **Sensor:** Thermostat.
* **Controller:** Digital control unit.
* **Actuator:** Compressor motor.
* **Feedback:** Temperature reading from the thermostat.
