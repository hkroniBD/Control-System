**Lecture 10: 🔄 Feedback Control Systems – Concepts and Applications**

## **🚦 Ice-Breaker**

Imagine trying to keep a drone hovering at a fixed altitude in windy conditions. Without continuous adjustments, it would drift away. Feedback control works similarly — the system measures its output, compares it to the desired value, and automatically corrects errors to maintain desired performance.

---

## **1️⃣ Introduction to Feedback Control**

Feedback control is the process of taking a portion of the output and feeding it back to the input to regulate the system's behavior.

**Key Objectives:**

* Reduce errors between desired and actual outputs.
* Improve stability and robustness.
* Enhance performance under disturbances and uncertainties.
* Facilitate automated and precise operation in dynamic environments.

💡 Note: Most real-world control systems (cars, aircraft, temperature control, robotics) use feedback to achieve precise and reliable operation.

## **2️⃣ Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop Systems**

| System Type                   | Description                                              | Example                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open-Loop** 🔓              | No feedback; output is not measured or corrected         | Washing machine running for fixed time regardless of cleanliness |
| **Closed-Loop (Feedback)** 🔒 | Uses output measurement to adjust input and reduce error | Thermostat-controlled heater maintaining room temperature        |

💡 Note: Closed-loop systems are more complex but provide higher accuracy, robustness, and adaptability to disturbances.

## **3️⃣ Components of a Feedback Control System**

* **Reference Input (R)** 🎯: Desired value.
* **Controller (C)** ⚙️: Determines corrective action.
* **Plant/Process (P)** 🏭: System to be controlled.
* **Sensor/Measurement (H)** 📏: Measures output.
* **Error Signal (E)** ❌: Difference between reference and measured output.

💡 Note: The error drives the controller to reduce the discrepancy, ensuring system performance meets the target.

## **4️⃣ Types of Feedback Controllers**

### **Basic Controllers:**

* **Proportional (P)**: Correction proportional to error; improves response speed but may leave steady-state error.
* **Integral (I)**: Correction based on accumulated error; eliminates steady-state error but may cause overshoot.
* **Derivative (D)**: Correction based on rate of change of error; improves stability and reduces overshoot.
* **PID Controller**: Combines P, I, and D for balanced transient and steady-state performance.

### **Other Feedback Controllers:**

* **PI Controller**: Combines proportional and integral; widely used in process control.
* **PD Controller**: Combines proportional and derivative; suitable for systems needing fast response with minimal overshoot.
* **Lead and Lag Controllers**: Modify system phase and gain to improve transient response and steady-state performance.
* **Adaptive Controllers** 🔄: Adjust controller parameters in real-time to handle systems with varying dynamics.
* **State Feedback Controllers** 📐: Use all system states for control; often applied in advanced robotics and aerospace systems.
* **Fuzzy Logic Controllers** 🤖: Handle nonlinearities and uncertainties without a precise mathematical model.

💡 Example: In an automatic cruise control system, a PID controller maintains speed, while an adaptive controller can adjust parameters if vehicle load changes significantly.
