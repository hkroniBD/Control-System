## 🌟 1. Ice-Breaker — Why Do We Need Control Systems?

Imagine:

* A **car without a steering wheel** — direction control is impossible.
* An **AC without a thermostat** — room may overheat or freeze.
* A **factory machine without automation** — slow, error-prone production.

**Control systems are the “brain” of machines** — they make systems **work as desired**.

---

## 🛠️ 2. What is Control System Engineering?

> **Definition:** The branch of engineering that focuses on designing and analyzing systems that behave predictably by adjusting their inputs to get desired outputs.

**Key idea:**

* Measure → Compare with target → Adjust → Achieve desired result.

## 🔄 3. General Structure of a Control System

**Core Components:**

1. **Input (Setpoint)** — Desired value
2. **Controller** — Makes decisions
3. **Process/Plant** — The system being controlled
4. **Output** — Actual system result
5. **Feedback** — Measurement sent back to controller

**Block Diagram:**

```
[Input] → [Controller] → [Process/Plant] → [Output]
                   ↑                 ↓
                [Feedback] <---------
```
