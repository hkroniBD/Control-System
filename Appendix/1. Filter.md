**🎯 Objective:** To understand how we design filters by strategically placing Poles and Zeros and to see their effects simulated in MATLAB.

### **1. 🎛️ Introduction & The Building Blocks**

A filter's transfer function is `H(s) = K * (s - z₁)(s - z₂)... / (s - p₁)(s - p₂)...`.
*   `K`: **Gain** 📈
*   `zᵢ`: **Zeros** ➖ -> `H(s) = 0` when `s = zᵢ`. **Attenuates** frequencies near it.
*   `pᵢ`: **Poles** ⚠️ -> `H(s) → ∞` when `s = pᵢ`. **Dominates** response and stability.

---

### **2. 🧪 Example 1: Basic Low-Pass Filter (Single Pole)**

**Theory:** A single real pole creates a low-pass filter. Its location `s = -a` sets the **bandwidth (`BW = a` rad/s)** and **decay rate (`σ = -a`)**.

**MATLAB Code:**
```matlab
% Example 1: Low-Pass Filter (RC Circuit)
% H(s) = 1 / (1 + s/100) | Pole at s = -100 | Bandwidth = 100 rad/s

sys1 = tf(1, [1/100 1]); % Create Transfer Function object

% Plot Step Response to see decay rate
figure(1);
subplot(2,1,1);
step(sys1);
grid on;
title('Step Response: Decay Rate dictated by Pole at s = -100');
ylabel('Amplitude');

% Plot Bode Plot to see Bandwidth
subplot(2,1,2);
bode(sys1);
grid on;
title('Bode Plot: Bandwidth (~100 rad/s) shown by -3dB point');
```
**📊 Output Interpretation:**
*   **Top Plot (Step Response):** The output rises exponentially and settles. The speed of this response is the **decay rate** of the system's natural dynamics.
*   **Bottom Plot (Bode Plot):** The magnitude plot is flat at low frequencies and rolls off after the **bandwidth (corner frequency)**, which is exactly 100 rad/s (≈15.9 Hz). The phase shifts from 0° to -90°.

### **3. ⚡ Example 2: Effect of Pole Location**

**Theory:** Moving the pole left (more negative) **increases bandwidth** and **speeds up the decay** (system responds faster). Moving it right does the opposite.

**MATLAB Code:**
```matlab
% Example 2: Comparing Pole Locations
% Fast System: H_fast(s) = 1 / (1 + s/500) | Pole at s = -500
% Slow System: H_slow(s) = 1 / (1 + s/20)  | Pole at s = -20

H_fast = tf(1, [1/500 1]);
H_slow = tf(1, [1/20 1]);

% Compare Step Responses
figure(2);
step(H_fast, H_slow);
grid on;
legend('Fast System (Pole at s=-500)', 'Slow System (Pole at s=-20)');
title('Effect of Pole Location on Response Speed & Decay Rate');

% Compare Bode Plots (Magnitude)
figure(3);
bode(H_fast, H_slow);
grid on;
legend('Fast System', 'Slow System');
title('Effect of Pole Location on Bandwidth');
```
**📊 Output Interpretation:**
*   **Figure 2 (Step Response):** The `H_fast` system (green) settles much more quickly than the `H_slow` system (blue). Its decay rate is higher.
*   **Figure 3 (Bode Plot):** The `H_fast` system has a much wider **bandwidth**; it passes higher frequencies before they start to be attenuated.

### **4. ✨ Example 3: The Effect of a Zero**

**Theory:** A zero **adds a "boost"** to the frequency response above its location and can **speed up the step response**.

**MATLAB Code:**
```matlab
% Example 3: Adding a Zero
% H_LP(s) = 1 / (1 + s/100)         (Low-Pass with no zero)
% H_HP(s) = (1 + s/100) / (1 + s/100) = 1  (Zero cancels Pole -> All-Pass)
% H_Notch(s) = (1 + s/50) / (1 + s/100)   (Zero at s=-50, Pole at s=-100)

H_LP = tf(1, [1/100 1]); % Our original Low-Pass filter
H_Notch = tf([1/50 1], [1/100 1]); % Zero at s=-50

% Compare Step Responses
figure(4);
step(H_LP, H_Notch);
grid on;
legend('Pure Low-Pass (No Zero)', 'With Zero at s=-50');
title('Effect of a Zero on Step Response: Faster Rise Time');

% Compare Bode Plots
figure(5);
bode(H_LP, H_Notch);
grid on;
legend('Pure Low-Pass', 'With Zero');
title('Effect of a Zero on Frequency Response: "Boost"');
```
**📊 Output Interpretation:**
*   **Figure 4 (Step Response):** The system *with* the zero (green) has a much faster rise time. The zero "pulls" the response up more quickly.
*   **Figure 5 (Bode Plot):** The system *with* the zero shows a "boost" or shelf in the frequency response. The gain is higher for frequencies between the zero (50 rad/s) and the pole (100 rad/s) compared to the pure low-pass filter.

### **5. 🌀 Example 4: Band-Pass Filter (Poles & a Zero)**

**Theory:** A band-pass filter can be made by using a zero to block low frequencies and poles to block high frequencies.

**MATLAB Code:**
```matlab
% Example 4: Simple Band-Pass Filter
% H(s) = (s/50) / ( (s/10 + 1)(s/500 + 1) )
% Zero at s = 0 (blocks DC)
% Pole 1 at s = -10 (sets low-freq roll-off)
% Pole 2 at s = -500 (sets high-freq roll-off)

numerator = [1/50 0]; % Represents (s/50 + 0)
denominator = conv([1/10 1], [1/500 1]); % Represents (s/10 + 1)(s/500 + 1)

H_BP = tf(numerator, denominator);

% Plot the Bode Plot to see the Passband
figure(6);
bode(H_BP);
grid on;
title('Bode Plot of a Band-Pass Filter');
% The "hump" between ~10 rad/s and ~500 rad/s is the passband.

% Plot the Impulse Response
figure(7);
impulse(H_BP);
grid on;
title('Impulse Response of Band-Pass Filter');
% Shows the oscillatory nature within the passband.
```

### **6. ✅ Summary & Key MATLAB Functions**

| Concept | MATLAB Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create Transfer Function** | `sys = tf(num, den)` | Defines `H(s)=num/den`. |
| **Plot Step Response** | `step(sys)` | Visualizes time-domain response to a sudden change. Shows **decay rate** and settling time. |
| **Plot Frequency Response** | `bode(sys)` | Plots magnitude (dB) and phase (deg) vs. frequency. Shows **bandwidth** and filter shape. |
| **Plot Impulse Response** | `impulse(sys)` | Visualizes the system's natural response. |
| **Get Pole/Zero Locations** | `pole(sys)`, `zero(sys)` | Calculates the exact poles and zeros. |
| **Plot on s-plane** | `pzmap(sys)` | Creates a plot showing Pole (X) and Zero (O) locations. |

**Final Thought:** MATLAB provides an essential playground for translating the abstract concepts of poles and zeros into tangible, visual results for both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. Experimenting with these commands is the best way to build intuition.
